//! The stund client-server communication protocol.
//!
//! [Stund](https://github.com/pkgw/stund) is a simple daemon for maintaining
//! SSH tunnels. This crate defines the communication protocol used between
//! the CLI client and the daemon that acts as the parent to SSH processes.
//!
//! The protocol only has a handful of commands at the moment. These are
//! defined in this main module. The [`client`] submodule implements the
//! client protocol.
